# **Hot-reload demo**

## **How to use**

First, use `watch_build.sh` to watch the source file changes for rebuilding.

Then, use `watch_run.sh` to reload the lib for running code.

Such as:

```
doing stuff
doing stuff
doing stuff
doing stuff
doing stuff
doing stuff233
doing stuff233
doing stuff233
...
```
